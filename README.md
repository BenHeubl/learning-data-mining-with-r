###Notes:<br/> 
1. [The book of this project can be found at the site of Packt Publishing Limited] (https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-data-mining-r) <br/>

2. Every algorithm will be provided in five levels of difficulty.<br/>
(1). Level 1 is the basic form for reader to understand the algorithm in a straight way.<br/>
(2). Level 2 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages.<br/>
(3). Level 3 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.<br/>
(4). Level 4 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages and solutions.<br/>
(5). Level 5 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.<br/>

3. Target for a brand new data mining framework
