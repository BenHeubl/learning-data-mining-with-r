Notes: 
1. Every algorithm will be provided in five levels of difficulty. 
(1). Level 1 is the basic form for reader to understand the algorithm in a straight way.
(2). Level 2 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages.
(3). Level 3 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.
(4). Level 4 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages and solutions.
(5). Level 5 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.
